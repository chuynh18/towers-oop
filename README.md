# Towers

I'm just imitating the game you can find [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/towers.html).

## Motivation

- Play more with TypeScript, especially with "stricter" `tsconfig.json` options.
- Play with the `canvas` element.
- Algorithmic practice (specifically, the board generation algorithm).

## Future development

First version will be purely client-side, even though I have some stubbed out server code.  I may never get to building out the server-side, as that won't really bring much to this game from a product perspective.
